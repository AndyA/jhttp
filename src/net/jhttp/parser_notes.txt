The Parser class operates on buffers that make up a HTTP response.

Though its functionality is mostly generic to requests and responses, it is
optimized a little bit for response processing.

As it reads through a buffer byte by byte it will go through one of a few
states: 

  BG    Begin
  LF    Reading next character as LF (after CR)
  W     Ignoring whitespace
  F_1   Reading status line field 1
  F_1_2 Reading SP between field 1 and 2
  F_2   Reading field 2
  F_2_3 Reading SP between field 2 and 3
  F_3   Reading field 3
  H     Inside headers
  HN    Reading header name
  HV    Inside or at the end of a header value
  HVV   Reading header value
  BS    Reading body separator (CRLF)
  B     Reading body

Chunking is not yet supported.

As soon as the parser moves on to a character that allows it to unambiguously
know that a particular value has been fully parsed, it will emit that value (for
use by its listeners).

The parser needs a little help from its listener to determine whether to expect
a body: it asks its listener for isHeadRequest(), unless it already knows there
will not be a body anyway (Content-Length 0, or status code 1xx, 204 or 304).
If there is no body

Given:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type:
      text/html;
      charset=ISO-8859-1
    Content-Length: 11

    Hello World

Here are the parser states and explanations of when things are emitted:

Example:

   HTTP/1.1 SP    200     SP    OK  CR    LF
^  ^        ^     ^       ^     ^   ^     ^

            E:F_1         E:F_2     E:F_3

Content-Type:     CR      LF
^           ^     ^       ^
HN          W|HV  LF|W|HV W|HV
            E:HN

SP     SP      text/html;  CR      LF
^      ^       ^           ^       ^
